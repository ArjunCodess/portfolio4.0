## 🧠 AI Chatbot & RAG Architecture

This portfolio features a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that allows visitors to "chat" with the portfolio. Unlike standard chatbots, this one knows specific details about my work, skills, and background by querying a structured knowledge base.

### How it Works

1.  **Ingestion Pipeline** (`scripts/generate-embeddings.ts`):
    - Source content (Markdown files) is read from `src/data/rag`.
    - Text is chunked into semantic segments (~800 characters) with overlap.
    - **Cloud Embeddings**: We use Google Gemini's `gemini-embedding-2-preview` model via the Vercel AI SDK for high-quality 768-dimensional embeddings.
    - Vectors are stored in **Vercel Postgres** using the `pgvector` extension.

2.  **Retrieval System**:
    - When a user asks a question, their query is converted to a vector embedding using the same Gemini model.
    - We perform a **cosine similarity search** in Postgres to find the most relevant content chunks.
    - The top 5 matching chunks are retrieved to form the "context".

3.  **Generation Phase**:
    - The user's query and the retrieved context are fed into **Google's Gemini Flash** model (via Vercel AI SDK).
    - The model generates a response based _only_ on the provided facts, minimizing hallucinations.
    - The response is streamed back to the UI in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Animations:** Framer Motion, Magic UI

### AI & Data

- **LLM:** Google Gemini Flash
- **SDK:** Vercel AI SDK
- **Embeddings:** Google Gemini (`gemini-embedding-2-preview`, 768 dimensions)
- **Database:** Vercel Postgres (with `pgvector`)
- **Vector Search:** SQL-based cosine similarity

### Deployment

- **Platform:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

### Installation

Check out [.env.example](.env.example) to see the required environment variables.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArjunCodess/portfolio.git
cd portfolio

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your POSTGRES_URL for the guestbook feature

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Setting up the Knowledge Base (RAG)

To make the chatbot work locally, you need to generate embeddings for the data:

```bash
# 1. Ensure your .env.local has:
#    - POSTGRES_URL connection string
#    - GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY for embeddings

# 2. Run the embedding generation script
pnpm db:generate-embeddings
```

This will read from `src/data/rag/*.md`, generate vectors using Gemini, and populate your database.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the portfolio.

### Code Formatting

To ensure the code follows the project's style guidelines, you can run the prettier script:

```bash
pnpm pretty
```

This will automatically format all supported files in the project.

## 🎨 Customization Guide

This portfolio is designed to be easily customized. Here is how you can make it yours:

### 1. Update Personal Information (`src/data/resume.tsx`)

The entire portfolio is data-driven. You don't need to dig into React components to change the text. Open `src/data/resume.tsx` and update the `DATA` constant:

- **Name & Brand**: Update `name`, `initials`, and `personalBrand`.
- **Social Links**: modifying the `contact.social` object.
- **Work & Education**: Update the `work` and `education` arrays.
- **Projects**: content for the "Projects" section is in the `projects` array.

### 2. Update the AI Knowledge Base (RAG)

The AI Chatbot answers questions based on markdown files in `src/data/rag/`. To teach the AI about **you**:

1.  **Delete existing files** in `src/data/rag/`.
2.  **Add your own Markdown files**. You can organize them however you like (e.g., `bio.md`, `experience.md`, `hobbies.md`).
3.  **Automate Project Data** (`scripts/fetch-projects.ts`):
    - This script automatically fetches your project details (stars, descriptions, READMEs) from GitHub and saves them to `src/data/rag/projects.md`.
    - **How to use**: Update the `USERNAME` and `REPOS_TO_FETCH` arrays in `scripts/fetch-projects.ts`, then run:
      ```bash
      npx tsx scripts/fetch-projects.ts
      ```
    - _Note: This is why `scripts/fetch-projects.ts` exists—to keep your AI knowledge base in sync with your actual GitHub data!_
4.  **Re-generate embeddings**:
    ```bash
    pnpm db:generate-embeddings
    ```
    This script will chunk your new text, create vectors, and store them in your database so the AI accepts them as truth.

### 3. Tips for Best Results

- **Be Specific**: When writing your RAG files, be descriptive. Instead of "I like coding", say "I enjoy building scalable web apps with Next.js and Postgres".
- **Images**: Add your photos to the `public/` folder and reference them in `resume.tsx` (e.g., `avatarUrl: "/me.jpg"`).
