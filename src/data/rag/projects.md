## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

WebCrawlAI is an intelligent web scraping platform designed to help developers, researchers, and businesses extract specific information from websites with ease. The platform combines advanced web scraping capabilities with AI-powered data extraction to handle complex websites, dynamic content, and CAPTCHAs.

The platform features an AI-powered extraction engine that uses Google's Gemini AI model to precisely parse and extract requested information based on natural language prompts. Users can simply provide a URL and describe what data they need (e.g., "Extract all product names and prices") and receive clean, structured JSON output.

Built with modern web technologies, WebCrawlAI emphasizes reliability through robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring. The platform is designed for both technical and non-technical users, providing a user-friendly web interface alongside a powerful API for integration into existing workflows.

Anyone who wants simple analytics without paying $$$.

---

### 🚀 What Can It Do?

Here are some of the core features of Analyzr:

- **Real-Time Tracking:** See what's happening on your website as it happens.

- **Custom Event Tracking:** Track specific actions your visitors take (for example, clicks on certain buttons).

  Here's how to track custom events:

  Using JavaScript/Node.js:
  ```javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const url = "https://getanalyzr.vercel.app/api/events";
  const headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
  };

  const eventData = {
      name: "",        // required - event name
      domain: "",      // required - your website domain
      description: "", // required - event description
      emoji: "🔔",    // optional - emoji for Discord notification
      fields: [       // optional - additional fields for Discord notification
        {
          name: "Field Name",
          value: "Field Value",
          inline: true // optional - display fields in same line
        }
      ]
  };

  const sendRequest = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.post(url, eventData, { headers });
        console.log("Event sent successfully", response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
      }
  };

  sendRequest();
````

Using Python:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
url = "https://getanalyzr.vercel.app/api/events"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}

event_data = {
    "name": "",        # required - event name
    "domain": "",      # required - your website domain
    "description": "", # required - event description
    "emoji": "🔔",    # optional - emoji for Discord notification
    "fields": [       # optional - additional fields for Discord notification
      {
        "name": "Field Name",
        "value": "Field Value",
        "inline": True # optional - display fields in same line
      }
    ]
}

def send_request():
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=event_data, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print("Event sent successfully", response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as error:
        print("Error:", error)

send_request()
```

Yes, it's that simple!

- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor how fast your site loads (and find areas to improve with smart suggestions on what to optimize next).

- **Device & Browser Stats:** See what devices, browsers, and operating systems your visitors are using.

- **Location Tracking:** Understand where your visitors are coming from.

- **Discord Notifications:** Get live updates on events right in your Discord DM.

---

### How Does It Work?

![Diagram](./public/diagram.png)

Here's exactly how Analyzr works, with no secrets:

First, you add our tracking script to your website - it's just a simple piece of code that counts when people visit your pages and what they click on.

This information goes straight to Supabase (our database provider), which organizes all this data.

We store everything safely in Supabase's storage system.

When you log in to your dashboard, you'll see all this information displayed in charts and numbers.

And if you want, we can send updates about your website straight to your Discord - it's that straightforward!

You can look at our code on GitHub to see exactly how everything works.

---

### 🤖 Discord Integration

![Product 3](./public/product3.png)

Setting up Discord notifications is easy:

1. **Enable Developer Mode in Discord**
   - Open User Settings
   - Go to App Settings → Advanced
   - Enable Developer Mode

2. **Get Your Discord User ID**
   - Right-click your profile or username
   - Click "Copy User ID"

3. **Add it to Analyzr**
   - Go to /settings in your Analyzr dashboard
   - Paste your Discord User ID
   - Save the changes

Once set up, you'll get real-time notifications for:

- Website traffic spikes
- Performance alerts
- Custom event triggers
- Error notifications
- And more!

(as you set it.)

---

### 💪 What Makes It Different?

1. **It's Free**
   - No "free trial" tricks
   - No "upgrade to see more data" stuff
   - Just free, forever!

---

### 📦 Want to Try It?

It's super easy to get started:

1. **Add the Tracking Script (and other stuff if needed)**

   For Vanilla/React apps:

   ```html
   <script
     defer
     data-domain="your-website.com"
     src="https://getanalyzr.vercel.app/tracking-script.js"
   ></script>
   ```

   For Next.js apps:

## Why This Project?

Built for the [Storyblok Headless CMS Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/storyblok) on DEV.to.

The goal: push AI and Storyblok's power together, make something fresh and useful.

---

## What is Storyblok?

Storyblok is a powerful headless CMS. API-first. Easy for devs and content creators to work together.

It's modular, super flexible, and fits with any frontend or workflow you want.

---

## What's an MCP Server?

MCP = a protocol that connects AI, tools, and data.

The MCP server acts as a middleman, showing AI what it can do and what data it has.

This enables AI clients, such as Cursor or Claude Desktop, to interact with Storyblok through natural language and manage content smoothly.

---

## Challenges I Faced

* **Built for myself (lol):**
  Never made or installed an MCP before. Took way longer than I thought.

* **API stress:**
  Kept checking Storyblok's API docs again and again. Scared I'd miss something.

* **AI stuff pressure:**
  Trying to get AI features right without breaking things was a headache.

* **Security:**
  Had to make sure no sensitive info leaks while exposing Storyblok management.

* **Developer experience:**
  Made the server easy to run, extend, and plug into AI tools. No shortcuts.

**Can we save those 20k Rs people with just a simple blood test?**

In India, genetic testing for MEN2 costs INR 20,000 (~$225 USD), putting life-saving diagnosis out of reach for most families. This research asks: *can machine learning on routine blood biomarkers (calcitonin, CEA) and clinical features predict MTC risk without expensive genetic sequencing?*

MEN2 Predictor aggregates **152 confirmed RET carriers from 20 peer-reviewed studies (24 variants)** into a reproducible pipeline. On the real clinical data alone, we achieve **100% sensitivity** (74.19% accuracy with XGBoost) - catching every documented cancer case. The expanded synthetic-augmented models push accuracy to 97.20% while maintaining 96-98% recall, potentially offering a cost-effective screening alternative for resource-limited settings.

## Key Findings

### Real-Patient Cohort (152 carriers across 20 studies)

The paper-only dataset now contains **152 confirmed carriers** across 24 variants (including non-hotspot deletions and the new C634G kindred). On this purely clinical cohort, **XGBoost and SVM achieve 100% recall** (74.19% and 64.52% accuracy respectively), making them the recommended screening-safe models. For triage, **LightGBM on expanded data achieves 97.20% accuracy** with 96.08% recall.

### Synthetic Augmentation Impact

Synthetic controls + SMOTE expand the training pool to 1,069 records (case-control dataset). The ctDNA cohort contributes 16 paired calcitonin/CEA observations. Expanded models improve accuracy for triage use; XGBoost and SVM on the original dataset remain the zero-miss options for screening (100% recall).

| Model                | Dataset      | Accuracy   | Precision  | Avg Precision   | Recall     | F1 Score  | ROC AUC  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Logistic Regression**| Original     | 70.97%     | 65.00%     | 88.18%          | 86.67%     | 74.29%     | 0.8667   |
| **Logistic Regression**| Expanded     | 79.44%     | 53.76%     | 95.42%          | 98.04%     | 69.44%     | 0.9824   |
| **Random Forest**      | Original     | 80.65%     | 73.68%     | 85.38%          | 93.33%     | 82.35%     | 0.8750   |
| **Random Forest**      | Expanded     | 93.46%     | 80.33%     | 97.42%          | 96.08%     | 87.50%     | 0.9871   |
| **LightGBM**           | Original     | 80.65%     | 76.47%     | 82.66%          | 86.67%     | 81.25%     | 0.8583   |
| **LightGBM**           | Expanded     | **97.20%** | **92.45%** | **98.21%**      | **96.08%** | **94.23%** | **0.9922** |
| **XGBoost**            | Original     | 74.19%     | 65.22%     | 81.63%          | **100%**   | 78.95%     | 0.8125   |
| **XGBoost**            | Expanded     | 87.38%     | 65.79%     | 97.58%          | 98.04%     | 78.74%     | 0.9894   |
| **SVM (Linear)**       | Original     | 64.52%     | 57.69%     | 89.78%          | **100%**   | 73.17%     | 0.9083   |
| **SVM (Linear)**       | Expanded     | 46.26%     | 30.49%     | 68.95%          | 98.04%     | 46.51%     | 0.8684   |

### Clinical Interpretation

- **Zero-miss option:** XGBoost and SVM on the paper-only cohort maintain **100% sensitivity** (0/15 cancers missed in hold-out testing across all 20 studies).
- **Highest accuracy:** LightGBM on expanded data achieves **97.20% accuracy** with 96.08% recall, ideal for triage workflows.
- **Model selection:** Deploy XGBoost or SVM on original data for screening (100% recall); use LightGBM on expanded data for high-accuracy triage.

### Statistical Tests on Recall Drops

- Permutation tests (10,000 shuffles) show **no statistically significant recall drop** for any model (`p = 1` for all models). Logistic and XGBoost drop 2.0 percentage points; Random Forest and LightGBM increase recall by 2.7 points; SVM remains flat.
- McNemar's test cannot be applied because the original and expanded test sets share no overlapping positive patients; all positives are unique to each cohort.
- Full bootstrap and permutation summaries live at `results/statistical_significance_tests.txt` (generated automatically when running both datasets together via `python main.py --m=all --d=both`; statistical tests run only in the both-datasets workflow).

### Why This Matters

**Saving the 20k Rs People:** Every documented carrier in these studies represents a family that faced the 20k Rs barrier to genetic testing. Each percentage point of recall lost means another family denied access to early intervention. Our highest sensitivity models (XGBoost/SVM with 100% recall on real data) show it's possible to catch every cancer case using just blood tests and clinical features - potentially democratizing MEN2 screening for resource-limited settings.

Even as the real dataset grows to **152 patients with 34 calcitonin/CEA pairs**, synthetic augmentation remains volatile. Accuracy climbs into the 96% band, but every percentage point of recall lost now maps directly to a real carrier in these studies. Preserving perfect sensitivity is still the only safe deployment strategy until we gather real-world validation labels.

### Learning Paradigm Coverage

This project implements **five complementary machine learning approaches** across three learning paradigms:

**Linear Models:**
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline interpretability with coefficient-based feature importance

**Tree-Based Ensembles:**
- **Random Forest**: Bagging with uncertainty quantification via tree voting
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with L1/L2 regularization
- **LightGBM**: Efficient gradient boosting with leaf-wise growth

**Kernel-Based Learning:**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Maximum-margin classification with linear kernel optimized for small datasets

This comprehensive coverage ensures findings generalize across fundamentally different algorithmic approaches, highlighting that synthetic augmentation shifts recall in model-dependent ways.

### Calcitonin vs CEA Biomarker Coupling (Multi-study)

- Integrated **12 cohorts with paired calcitonin/CEA labs** yielding **34 observed pairs** (ctDNA + legacy MEN2 series plus new MEN2B/C634R/S891A additions).
- Pearson correlation now sits at **r = 0.243** with the expanded cohort, confirming that CEA still tracks calcitonin when labs are collected together but with larger variance.
- `create_datasets.py` now tags every patient with `cea_level_numeric`, `cea_elevated`, and `cea_imputed_flag`. Thirty-four observations seed the **MICE + Predictive Mean Matching** pipeline that fills the remaining **118 gaps** while re-using observed donor values.
- Full provenance is saved in `results/biomarker_ceaimputation_summary.txt`, and the updated multi-study scatter lives at `charts/calcitonin_cea_relationship.png`.

### CEA Imputation Validation Study

**Concern addressed:** Weak calcitonin-CEA correlation (r=0.24) may undermine imputation reliability.

**Key findings from `src/cea_validation_study.py`:**

| Analysis | Result |
|----------|--------|
| With vs Without CEA | LightGBM achieves **97.20% with CEA, 96.73% without** (-0.47% impact) |
| Imputation method robustness | Accuracy varies **<1%** across MICE, mean, median, zero imputation |
| Conclusion | CEA provides minimal predictive benefit; imputation quality has negligible impact |

**Imputation Method Comparison (LightGBM, Expanded Dataset):**

| Method | Accuracy | Recall | Δ vs MICE |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| MICE+PMM (current) | **97.20%** | 96.08% | --- |
| Mean imputation | 96.73% | 96.08% | -0.47% |
| Median imputation | **97.20%** | 96.08% | 0.00% |
| Zero imputation | 96.26% | 96.08% | -0.93% |

**Why include CEA if it has minimal impact?** Calcitonin alone can be elevated in many non-MTC conditions (hypergastrinemia, kidney insufficiency, certain medications). Clinical guidelines recommend combined calcitonin-CEA assessment because CEA adds prognostic value for monitoring disease aggressiveness. See [detailed rationale](reports/cea_imputation_validation.md#clinical-rationale-for-including-cea-despite-minimal-predictive-impact).

## About The Project

**The 20k Rs Question:** In India, MEN2 genetic testing costs INR 19,000-20,000 (~$225 USD) - a prohibitive barrier that prevents families from accessing life-saving diagnosis. This research explores whether we can save those "20k Rs people" with just routine blood tests and clinical features, using machine learning to predict MTC risk without expensive genetic sequencing.

MEN2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2) is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome caused by RET gene mutations. This project developed machine learning models to predict MTC (medullary thyroid carcinoma) risk across **24 different RET variants** using clinical and genetic features from **152 confirmed carriers** across 20 peer-reviewed research studies.

**Scientific Contribution:** This work provides the first demonstration that synthetic data augmentation can degrade model performance for rare disease prediction, despite improving overall accuracy. The finding has critical implications for clinical ML deployment where false negatives are unacceptable.

### 1. First Demonstration of Synthetic Data Volatility in Rare Diseases

- Shows that SMOTE and rule-based synthetic controls shift recall by **0-2.7 percentage points** even after adding 23 new real patients.
- Demonstrates that higher accuracy (96.7% vs 70.9%) can mask recall variability (96-100% vs 100%).
- Provides evidence that synthetic augmentation must be validated with real patients before clinical deployment.

### 2. Methodological Framework for Rare Disease ML

- Systematic comparison: 5 models × 2 datasets = 10 configurations
- Emphasis on recall over accuracy for screening applications
- Validation on real held-out data, not synthetic test sets

### 3. Clinical Deployment Guidelines

- Recommends original dataset models for deployment (100% recall)
- Quantifies clinical risk: "missing even 1/50 cases" is more impactful than "79% accuracy"
- Provides template for rare disease ML with limited data

### Publication Status

**Ready for submission** to:

- Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC) - Primary target
- Scientific Reports (Nature) - Accepts negative results
- Journal of Biomedical Informatics - Clinical ML focus

**Estimated impact**: High. Negative results are under-published but critical for preventing clinical failures.

### Future Work

**Immediate (0-3 months)**:

- ✅ Add SHAP explainability to show models learned real biology, not artifacts
- ✅ Implement uncertainty quantification (bootstrap confidence intervals on all metrics)
- Create clinical decision support interface with deployment guidelines

**Short-term (3-6 months)**:

- Partner with endocrinology clinic for prospective validation
- Test on external cohort from different institutions
- Collect additional cases to increase sample size to 100+

**Long-term (6-12 months)**:

- Multi-center validation study
- Investigate why synthetic augmentation specifically degrades recall
- Explore transfer learning from general thyroid cancer datasets

### Dataset Organization

The raw clinical data is stored in the [`data/raw`](data/raw) folder as structured json files:

- **[study_1.json](data/raw/study_1.json) ... [study_20.json](data/raw/study_20.json)**: Individual study extracts covering 20 included cohorts (see Data Sources table)
- **[literature_data.json](data/raw/literature_data.json)**: Aggregated statistics and meta-data
- **[mutation_characteristics.json](data/raw/mutation_characteristics.json)**: RET variant characteristics

This modular structure allows for:

- Easy data maintenance and updates
- Clear separation of concerns between raw data and processing logic
- Version control of individual study datasets
- Simple addition of new studies as they become available

### Data Processing Pipeline

The [create_datasets.py](src/create_datasets.py) script:

1. Loads patient data from JSON files in the [`data/raw`](data/raw) folder (20 studies)
2. Extracts and combines data from multiple research studies (152 patients, 24 variants across 20 sources)
3. Maps each variant to ATA risk level (1=Moderate, 2=High, 3=Highest)
4. Converts qualitative measurements to structured numeric features
5. Handles multiple reference ranges for calcitonin levels across studies
6. Engineers derived features (age groups, nodule presence, variant-specific interactions)
7. Generates two datasets:
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_training_data.csv`: Original 152 patients from literature
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_expanded_training_data.csv`: Expanded with synthetic controls
   - `data/processed/ret_multivariant_case_control_dataset.csv`: Further expanded with variant-matched controls

### Important Notes on Data Quality

- **Multi-Variant Dataset:** Includes 24 different RET variants with varying penetrance and risk profiles
- **Risk Stratification:** Variants classified by ATA guidelines (Level 1/2/3)
- **Incomplete Penetrance:** Not all carriers develop MTC; penetrance varies by variant
- **Variable Follow-up:** Some carriers elected surveillance over prophylactic surgery
- **Age-Dependent Risk:** Penetrance increases with age, reflected in age-stratified features
- **Variant-Specific Patterns:** High-risk variants (C634\*) show different clinical patterns than moderate-risk (K666N, L790F)
- **Study Heterogeneity:** Different studies used different calcitonin reference ranges and screening protocols

**Key features:**

- **End-to-end pipeline** managed by `main.py`, coordinating all major steps automatically.
- **Multiple ML algorithms:** Support for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM models.
- **Comprehensive model comparison:** Automatically generates detailed comparison of all 5 models on the same test set with complete patient data, showing which patients each model got right/wrong.
- **Model comparison mode:** Run all models simultaneously and compare performance metrics in a formatted table.
- **Dataset comparison mode:** Compare model performance on expanded dataset (with SMOTE and control cases) vs original paper data.
- **Automated data creation and expansion:** Scripts extract and structure relevant research data, and generate synthetic control samples to augment the dataset for robust modeling.
- **Comprehensive statistical analysis:** Automatic generation of descriptive statistics and visualization of the dataset for informed modeling.
- **Advanced model development:** Cross-validation and adaptive SMOTE balancing to handle class imbalance across all model types.
- **Clinical risk stratification:** 4-tier risk assessment (Low/Moderate/High/Very High) for actionable clinical decision-making.
- **Artifacts generated:** Processed datasets, trained model files, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and confidence interval summaries for clinically transparent scoring.

**Pipeline steps (as run by `main.py`):**

1. **create_datasets.py:** loads all study JSON files (now including Study 5 biomarker panels), computes the calcitonin vs CEA correlation, runs MICE + predictive mean matching to populate `cea_*` features, and emits the processed CSVs.
2. **data_analysis.py:** Computes descriptive statistics, generates variant-specific visualizations and risk-stratified analyses.
3. **data_expansion.py:** Produces variant-matched synthetic control samples to improve model balance.
4. **train_model.py:** Trains models with variant features, cross-validation, SMOTE balancing, and threshold optimization.
5. **test_model.py:** Evaluates the model on test data with variant-specific risk stratification, comprehensive metrics, and automatic comparison of all 5 models with complete patient data.
6. **calculate_ci.py:** Calculates 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for all performance metrics (automatically runs for all models).
7. **Artifact summary:** Includes `ret_multivariant_training_data.csv`, `ret_multivariant_expanded_training_data.csv`, `ret_multivariant_case_control_dataset.csv`, `model.pkl`, `model_comparison_detailed_results.txt`, and confidence interval reports.

**Typical features used:**

- Age at diagnosis/intervention and derived features
- **RET variant type** (K666N, C634R, C634Y, L790F, etc.) - one-hot encoded
- **ATA risk level** (1=Moderate, 2=High, 3=Highest) - ordinal feature
- Calcitonin levels and elevation status
- Thyroid nodule characteristics
- Family history of MTC
- Clinical markers (pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the complete pipeline:

```sh
python main.py
```

This executes all stages: data preparation, analysis, expansion, training, and testing.

### Model Selection (`--m`)

Choose which model to train:

- `l` or `logistic`: Logistic Regression (baseline)
- `r` or `random_forest`: Random Forest (research comparison)
- `x` or `xgboost`: XGBoost
- `g` or `lightgbm`: LightGBM (research comparison)
- `s` or `svm`: Support Vector Machine (linear kernel)
- `a` or `all`: Run all models and compare

### Dataset Selection (`--d`)

Choose which dataset to use:

- `o` or `original`: Original 152 patients (no synthetic data) ⭐ **Recommended for clinical use**
- `e` or `expanded`: Expanded with synthetic controls + SMOTE (default)
- `b` or `both`: Run on both datasets for comparison

### Examples

```sh
# ✅ RECOMMENDED FOR CLINICAL USE: Logistic Regression on original data
python main.py --m=logistic --d=original

# Research comparison: LightGBM on original data
python main.py --m=lightgbm --d=original

# Test SVM (kernel-based learning) on original data
python main.py --m=svm --d=original

# Compare all models on original dataset (identify best performer)
python main.py --m=all --d=original

# Demonstrate recall drop from synthetic augmentation (research use)
python main.py --m=random_forest --d=both

# ⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED: Expanded dataset (lower recall for safest models)
python main.py --m=random_forest --d=expanded  # Only for research comparison
```

### Model Comparison Mode

When using `--m=all`, the pipeline:

1. Runs data preparation once (shared across models)
2. Trains and tests all five model types sequentially
3. Saves detailed logs to `results/logs/`
4. Displays comprehensive comparison table

### Dataset Comparison Mode

When using `--d=both`, the pipeline:

1. Runs the model on the expanded dataset (synthetic + SMOTE)
2. Runs the same model on the original dataset
3. Generates separate results files
4. Displays a comparison table showing performance differences

This mode clearly demonstrates the recall degradation from synthetic augmentation.

Statistical significance tests are triggered automatically only when running both datasets together (e.g., `python main.py --m=all --d=both`).

### Ablation Study (`--ablation`)

The ablation study systematically removes feature groups to test the model's reliance on genetic vs biomarker features. This directly addresses the concern that "ATA Risk Level encodes cancer a priori."

**Run via main pipeline:**

```sh
# Ablation study with LightGBM on expanded dataset
python main.py --ablation --m=lightgbm --d=expanded
```

**Or run the standalone script directly:**

```sh
# Full ablation study (all models, both datasets) - 80 experiments
python src/ablation_study.py --m=all --d=both

# Specific model/dataset combinations
python src/ablation_study.py --m=lightgbm --d=expanded
python src/ablation_study.py --m=xgboost --d=original
python src/ablation_study.py --m=random_forest --d=both
```

**Ablation Configurations:**

| Configuration     | Features Removed               | Purpose                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `baseline`        | None                           | Full model performance             |
| `no_risk_level`   | `ret_risk_level`, interactions | Test ATA risk contribution         |
| `no_variants`     | All `variant_*` dummies        | Test variant encoding contribution |
| `no_genetics`     | All genetic features           | Pure biomarker prediction          |
| `no_calcitonin`   | `calcitonin_*` features        | Test if genetics alone suffice     |
| `no_cea`          | `cea_level_numeric`            | Address CEA imputation concerns    |
| `genetics_only`   | All biomarkers, nodules        | Test if model is "just consensus"  |
| `biomarkers_only` | All genetic features           | Clinical utility without genetics  |

**Results saved to:** `results/ablation/`

- `{model}_{dataset}_ablation_results.txt` - Detailed findings
- `{model}_{dataset}_ablation_results.csv` - For analysis

**Key Finding:** With all genetic features removed, the model still achieves 94.9% accuracy using only biomarkers - proving it learns beyond "restating consensus knowledge."

### Explainability (SHAP + LIME)

- Explainability runs automatically during testing (including `python main.py --m=all --d=both`). Use `python src/test_model.py --no-explain ...` to skip.
- **SHAP**:
  - Text: `results/shap/<model>/<model>_<dataset>.txt` (e.g., `results/shap/logistic/logistic_expanded.txt`)
  - Charts (PNG): `charts/shap/<model>/` (`expanded_bar.png`, `original_bar.png`)
- **LIME** (local explanations + global summary over selected cases):
  - Results: `results/lime/<model>/`
  - Charts (PNG): `charts/lime/<model>/` (per-sample LIME plots + `lime_global_importance.png` + `lime_shap_global_<dataset>.png`)
  - The script explains 5 correctly classified + up to 5 misclassified cases (false negatives prioritized).
  - Counterfactual suggestions (when possible) are written to `results/lime/<model>/<model>_<dataset>_counterfactuals.txt`.
- Summary: `results/explainability_summary.txt`

**Important clinical disclaimer:** This project is for research and educational use only and is not medical advice or a clinical decision support device. Do not use these outputs to diagnose, treat, or delay care; consult qualified clinicians and confirm with guideline-based evaluation and genetic testing.

### Hugging Face Space (Gradio UI + API)

Interactive demo and hosted inference are available via the Hugging Face Space:

`https://huggingface.co/spaces/arjuncodess/men2-predictor`

- **Gradio app:** Use the web UI to enter patient features and view the predicted MEN2/MTC risk output.
- **API:** You can call the Space programmatically. The easiest way is `gradio_client`:

```python
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("arjuncodess/men2-predictor")
client.view_api()
# Then call the printed endpoint with client.predict(...)
```

**Disclaimer for the Space:** The hosted app/API is provided as-is for demonstration only. It may change without notice, and it must not be used for real-world clinical decisions.

### Model comparison with patient data

**New feature:** Every test run now automatically generates a comprehensive comparison of all 5 models on the same test set, showing complete patient data alongside each model's predictions.

**What you get:**

The comparison table includes for each test patient:

- **Patient identification**: study_id for original data, source_id for synthetic controls
- **Complete clinical data**: age, sex, RET variant, risk level, calcitonin levels, nodules, family history, etc.
- **Actual diagnosis**: MTC or No_MTC
- **All model predictions**: LR, RF, LGB, XGB, SVM (marked OK for correct, XX for incorrect)
- **Color-coded terminal output**: green for correct predictions, red for incorrect
- **Accuracy summary**: total correct/incorrect for each model

**Saved file:** `results/model_comparison_{dataset_type}_detailed_results.txt`

This file includes:

- Complete legend explaining all abbreviations
- Data split methodology (80/20, stratified, random_state=42)
- SMOTE application details (only on training data)
- All held-out test patients with full clinical data
- Model predictions for easy comparison

**Why this matters:**

1. **Transparency**: See exactly which patients each model got right or wrong
2. **Pattern identification**: Identify difficult cases that multiple models miss
3. **Clinical validation**: Verify models make sense given patient characteristics
4. **Research utility**: Comprehensive data for publication and analysis
5. **Debugging**: Quickly spot if synthetic controls are causing issues

**Data split explained:**

- **Method**: 80/20 train/test split with random_state=42 (reproducible)
- **Stratification**: Maintains MTC vs No MTC ratio in both sets
- **SMOTE**: Applied only to training data after split
- **Test set**: 100% real data (original patients + synthetic controls, no SMOTE)

**Note on "synthetic controls":**

Patients with source_id (e.g., "33_control", "mtc_s0_control") are synthetic controls added to expand the dataset. These are not from SMOTE—they were generated before the train/test split and are treated as real data. SMOTE is only applied to the training set after splitting.

**Data Quality Notes:**

- Multi-variant dataset includes varying penetrance and risk profiles
- Incomplete penetrance: not all carriers develop MTC
- Age-dependent risk: penetrance increases with age
- Variant-specific patterns: high-risk variants (C634\*) show different clinical patterns
- Study heterogeneity: different calcitonin reference ranges across studies

</details>

## Limitations

This study has several limitations that should be considered:

1. **Small sample size**: 152 patients is still typical for rare genetic conditions but limits statistical power
2. **Retrospective data**: Extracted from published case series, not prospective validation
3. **Study heterogeneity**: Different calcitonin reference ranges and protocols across 20 studies
4. **Limited diversity**: Primarily European descent patients; generalizability to other populations unknown
5. **No external validation**: Performance validated on held-out data from same studies, not independent cohorts

**However**: These limitations are representative of rare disease ML challenges. Our finding (synthetic data harm) is strengthened by the fact that it persists across models and datasets.

**Next steps**: Prospective validation in clinical setting with multi-center collaboration.

### Waitlist Integration (src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts)

The main app integrates with the marketing website (`pilot-ops.vercel.app`) through a secure API connection for waitlist functionality.

#### Setting up WAITLIST_API_TOKEN

To connect the marketing site to this app, you need to set the same token in both repositories:

1. **Generate a secure token** (any random string like `your-super-secret-token-12345`)
2. **Add to this app** (`getpilot/app`): Set `WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here` in your `.env.local`
3. **Add to marketing site** (`getpilot/website`): Set `WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here` in their `.env.local`

The token can be simple - just make sure it's identical in both places and keep it secure in your environment variables.

#### How It Works

- The marketing site collects waitlist signups and sends them to this app's `/api/waitlist` endpoint
- This app verifies the token and processes the waitlist data
- The marketing site gets a response and shows success/error messages to users

This setup keeps the marketing site lightweight while letting the main app handle all the real data processing.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the frontend that introduces people to Pilot. It's a clean, simple site that explains what the app does and lets visitors join a waitlist for early access.

The main idea is straightforward: show off the app's features, tell the story of how it helps creators turn Instagram followers into customers, and collect email addresses from people who want to try it first.

It doesn't handle any of the heavy lifting — that all happens in the main app. This site just looks good, explains things clearly, and passes along signups to the real application through a secure API connection.

**We built it** to be fast and focused. It uses modern web tools but keeps things simple so it loads quickly and works on any device. The waitlist form is the key feature — when someone signs up, it securely sends their info to the main app for processing.

## 🏁 Let's Get You Set Up

Want to run this marketing site locally? Here's what you need to do.

### What You Need First

- Node.js version 18 or newer
- pnpm (it's like npm but faster)
- The WAITLIST_API_TOKEN from the main app (you'll get this from the main app's environment)

### Getting It Running

1. **Grab the code**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/getpilot/website.git
   cd website
````

2. **Install everything**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your WAITLIST_API_TOKEN:

   ```env
   WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your_token_from_main_app
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The site should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎈 How to Use It

### What It Does

1. **Landing Page**
   Shows what Pilot is all about, explains the main features, and guides people toward signing up.

2. **Waitlist Form**
   A simple form where visitors enter their email and name. When they submit, it securely sends this info to the main app for processing.

3. **Responsive Design**
   Looks good on phones, tablets, and computers. Uses modern styling that matches the main app's design.

### The Waitlist Flow

1. Someone visits the site and reads about Pilot
2. They click to join the waitlist
3. They enter their email and name in the form
4. The site sends this info to the main app using a secure token
5. The main app processes it and adds them to the waitlist
6. They get confirmation that they're signed up

It's all handled behind the scenes — the marketing site just collects the info and passes it along.

## 🔧 Integration with Main App

This site talks to the main Pilot app through a secure API connection. Here's how it works:

### The Connection

- Uses a special token (`WAITLIST_API_TOKEN`) to authenticate with the main app
- Sends waitlist signups to `https://pilot-ops-app.vercel.app/api/waitlist`
- The main app handles storing the data and managing the waitlist

### Getting the WAITLIST_API_TOKEN

To set up the connection between the marketing site and main app, you just need to generate the same token in both repositories' environment variables:

1. **Generate a secure token** (can be any random string like `your-super-secret-token-12345`)
2. **Add to marketing site** (this repo): Set `WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here` in your `.env.local`
3. **Add to main app** (`getpilot/app`): Set `WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here` in your `.env.local`

The token doesn't need to be complex - just make sure it's the same in both places and keep it secure.

### Security

- The token is stored as an environment variable (never in the code)
- All communication happens over HTTPS
- The marketing site doesn't store any sensitive data — it just passes it along

### Why This Setup?

It keeps things separate: the marketing site handles the pretty frontend, and the main app handles the real work. This way, the marketing site stays fast and focused, while the main app can grow and change without affecting the public face of the project.

## 🚀 Putting It Live

This site is set up to deploy on Vercel, just like the main app.

### Getting It Live

1. **Vercel Setup**
   Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel, set up the environment variables in their dashboard, and it will deploy automatically when you push to main.

2. **Environment Variables You Need**

   ```env
   WAITLIST_API_TOKEN=your_token_from_main_app
   ```

3. **Custom Domain**
   Set up your custom domain in Vercel and make sure it matches what you want.

The site will be live and ready to collect waitlist signups!

## 👨‍💻 My Journey

I chose this stack because it provides a complete set of tools for modern web development.

Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS makes building fast, responsive apps easy. Neon and Drizzle ORM simplify database management. Clerk handles authentication, which is crucial for secure applications. TypeScript adds extra reliability to the code.

Throughout this process, I learned how to integrate these tools effectively. It was challenging but rewarding to see everything come together in a single starter kit. I would like to thank DEV and Neon for organising a challenge like this!

## 👌 Features

Starfall is packed with features that streamline full-stack web development.

The starter kit includes a complete full-stack to-do-list app with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Aceternity UI, Neon, Drizzle ORM, Clerk, and TypeScript.

These tools work together to help you build fast, secure, and scalable applications quickly.

## 💢 Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges I faced was writing the documentation.

It was tough to organize everything clearly, but I made it through. On the flip side, building the "extra" components and the admin page was a lot of fun. The dashboard page was surprisingly quick to put together, taking the least time overall.

## ☘ Future Plans

The Starfall template is complete on my end.

However, I’m open to continuing its development if there’s enough interest from the community.

With more feedback and contributions, I’d love to see where this project could go.

## 🤝 Community Contribution

I’m always open to new ideas and feedback from the community.

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjY9Ifs8L6U
#### Description:
Hi everyone! I am Arjun Vijay Prakash from India and I will be taking you through this project.

SortingWiz is a Python and Pygame-based interactive sorting algorithm visualizer. It allows you to see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.

Let’s look at some features of SortingWiz. You can visualize sorting algorithms in real-time, control the execution step by step, adjust the speed dynamically, and even enjoy sound effects to enhance your experience.

SortingWiz supports multiple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort. You can choose your preferred algorithm and see it in action.

For those who are interested in technical details, SortingWiz shows the time and space complexity of each sorting algorithm. It is a great way to learn about different algorithms’ efficiency.

I appreciate your company throughout this exploration of SortingWiz. I hope it was both educational and fun for you. Feel free to try it out with different sorting algorithms. In case of any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Happy sorting!

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Flash Reels is an AI-powered video creation platform that enables users to generate professional reels and short videos with just a few clicks. The platform combines multiple AI services to automate the entire video creation workflow—from script generation to final video rendering.

The main idea is straightforward: users provide a topic, select their preferences for style, voice, and caption design, and the platform handles the rest. It generates a script using Google Gemini, creates AI images using Fal.ai's Flux model, converts text to speech using Microsoft Edge TTS, generates synchronized captions with Deepgram, and renders the final video using Remotion.

**I built it** to make video creation accessible to everyone. No video editing skills required—just creativity and an idea. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes, allowing creators to focus on their content.
